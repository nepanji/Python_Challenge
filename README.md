# Python_Challenge

## Purpose
This assignment represents an introduction to Python. It allowed me to demonstrate my ability to solve two real-world situations without Excel using my Python scripting skills.

## Background


This assignment included two python challenges:
    PyBank:  A financial analysis of a company's budget data was completed using python script. The analysis included a Finanical Analysis chart to display the results.
    PyPoll:  A polling analysis for an election was completed using python script. The analysis included an Election Analysis chart to display the results and the winner.

The completed assignment includes:
•	Financial Analysis of the results for the PyBank assignment
•	Election Analysis of the results for the PyPoll assignment
•	2 Separate Python script text files
•	README file


## Scripting Environment
I completed this assignment using Python in VS Code. I ran the script on macOS Big Sur 11.2.2.

## Scripting Details
Per the assignment, the script runs as requested. 

#### PyBank
The script was written to analyze the company records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 

#### PyPoll
The script was written to analyze the election results to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
